taxatree_models(
  ps,
  ranks = NULL,
  type = "lm",
  variables = NULL,
  formula = NULL,
  verbose = "rank",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ps}{phyloseq object or ps_extra}

\item{ranks}{vector of rank names at which to aggregate taxa for modelling}

\item{type}{name of regression modelling function, or the function itself}

\item{variables}{vector of variable names, to be used as model formula right hand side
(ignored if formula given)}

\item{formula}{(alternative to variables arg) right hand side of a formula,
as a formula object or character value}

\item{verbose}{message about progress}

\item{...}{extra arguments are passed directly to modelling function}
}
\description{
\code{taxatree_models} runs \code{tax_model} on every taxon at multiple taxonomic
ranks (you choose which ranks with the plural \code{ranks} argument).
It returns the results as a named nested list of models
attached to a ps_extra object.
One list per rank, one model per taxon at each rank.

The result can then be used with \code{taxatree_models2stats} to extract a
dataframe of statistics for use with \code{taxatree_plots}.
