\title{Create list describing taxa annotation}
\usage{
tax_anno(
  undetected = 0,
  which = "row",
  prev = 1,
  abund = 2,
  size = 30,
  gap = 2,
  rel_sizes = c(1, 1),
  ...
)

anno_prev(data, taxa, undetected = 0, which = "row", size = 15, ...)

anno_abund(data, taxa, undetected = 0, which = "row", size = 15, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{undetected}{value above which taxa are considered present/detected in a sample}

\item{which}{"row" or "column" annotation?}

\item{prev}{order in which prevalence annotation shown (number, or NA)}

\item{abund}{order in which abundance annotation shown (number, or NA)}

\item{size}{total size of all annotations in mm, excluding gaps (used as width or height, depending on value of which)}

\item{gap}{size of gap between annotations (in mm)}

\item{rel_sizes}{relative sizes of non-NA annotations (in given order)}

\item{...}{further args passed HeatmapAnnotation}
}
\description{
main usefulness of tax_anno function is to give sane defaults and prompt user which annotation options are available
