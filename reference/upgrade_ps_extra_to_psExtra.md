# Convert old format "ps_extra" objects to new "psExtra" objects

objects generated by an old microViz version (\< 0.10.0), and you cannot
or do not want to regenerate these old format objects from your original
phyloseq object.

## Usage

``` r
upgrade_ps_extra_to_psExtra(ps_extra)
```

## Arguments

- ps_extra:

  an old format "ps_extra" object, as generated by old microViz versions
  (\< 0.10.0)

## Value

new format "psExtra" S4 object

## Examples

``` r
# read your old saved 'ps_extra' object that you want to keep using
# oldObject <- readRDS("old-object-path.rds")
# newObject <- upgrade_ps_extra_to_psExtra(oldObject)
# continue with your next analysis or plotting steps...
```
