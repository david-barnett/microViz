## Installation

microViz is not (yet) available from CRAN.
You can install microViz from R Universe, or from GitHub.

I recommend you first install the Bioconductor dependencies using the code below.

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("phyloseq", "microbiome", "ComplexHeatmap"), update = FALSE)
```

### Installation of microViz from R Universe

``` r
install.packages(
  "microViz",
  repos = c(davidbarnett = "https://david-barnett.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos"))
)
```

I also recommend you install the following suggested CRAN packages.

``` r 
install.packages("ggtext") # for rotated labels on ord_plot() 
install.packages("ggraph") # for taxatree_plots()
install.packages("DT") # for tax_fix_interactive()
install.packages("corncob") # for beta binomial models in tax_model()
```

### Installation of microViz from GitHub

``` r
# Installing from GitHub requires the remotes package
install.packages("remotes")
# Windows users will also need to have RTools installed! http://jtleek.com/modules/01_DataScientistToolbox/02_10_rtools/

# To install the latest version:
remotes::install_github("david-barnett/microViz")

# To install a specific "release" version of this package, e.g. an old version 
remotes::install_github("david-barnett/microViz@0.13.0") 
```

### Installation notes

**:apple: macOS** **users** - might need to install [xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) to make the heatmaps work (to do this with homebrew, run the following command in your mac's Terminal: `brew install --cask xquartz`

:package: I recommend using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) for managing your R package installations across multiple projects.

:whale: For Docker users an image with the main branch installed is available at: <https://hub.docker.com/r/barnettdavid/microviz-rocker-verse>

:date: microViz is tested to work with recent R versions on Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu.
R versions below 4 are no longer supported since 0.13.0 (R 4.0.0 was released in 2020).

## Interactive ordination exploration

```{r}
library(microViz)
```

microViz provides a Shiny app for an easy way to start exploring your microbiome data: all you need is a phyloseq object.

```{r example ord_explore}
# example data from corncob package
pseq <- microViz::ibd %>%
  tax_fix() %>%
  phyloseq_validate()
```

``` r
ord_explore(pseq) # gif generated with microViz version 0.7.4 (plays at 1.75x speed)
```

![](vignettes/web-only/images/20210429_ord_explore_x175.gif)

## Example analyses (on HITChip data)

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(phyloseq)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r data setup}
# get some example data
data("dietswap", package = "microbiome")

# create a couple of numerical variables to use as constraints or conditions
dietswap <- dietswap %>%
  ps_mutate(
    weight = recode(bmi_group, obese = 3, overweight = 2, lean = 1),
    female = if_else(sex == "female", true = 1, false = 0),
    african = if_else(nationality == "AFR", true = 1, false = 0)
  )
# add a couple of missing values to show how microViz handles missing data
sample_data(dietswap)$african[c(3, 4)] <- NA
```

### Looking at your data

You have quite a few samples in your phyloseq object, and would like to visualize their compositions.
Perhaps these example data differ by participant nationality?

```{r, bars, fig.height=5, fig.width=6, dpi=120}
dietswap %>%
  comp_barplot(
    tax_level = "Genus", n_taxa = 15, other_name = "Other",
    taxon_renamer = function(x) stringr::str_remove(x, " [ae]t rel."),
    palette = distinct_palette(n = 15, add = "grey90"),
    merge_other = FALSE, bar_outline_colour = "darkgrey"
  ) +
  coord_flip() +
  facet_wrap("nationality", nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
```

```{r, compheatmap, fig.width=5.5, fig.height=3.5, dpi=120}
htmp <- dietswap %>%
  ps_mutate(nationality = as.character(nationality)) %>%
  tax_transform("log2", add = 1, chain = TRUE) %>%
  comp_heatmap(
    taxa = tax_top(dietswap, n = 30), grid_col = NA, name = "Log2p",
    taxon_renamer = function(x) stringr::str_remove(x, " [ae]t rel."),
    colors = heat_palette(palette = viridis::turbo(11)),
    row_names_side = "left", row_dend_side = "right", sample_side = "bottom",
    sample_anno = sampleAnnotation(
      Nationality = anno_sample_cat(
        var = "nationality", col = c(AAM = "grey35", AFR = "grey85"),
        box_col = NA, legend_title = "Nationality", size = grid::unit(4, "mm")
      )
    )
  )

ComplexHeatmap::draw(
  object = htmp, annotation_legend_list = attr(htmp, "AnnoLegends"),
  merge_legends = TRUE
)
```

### Example ordination plot workflow

Ordination methods can also help you to visualize if overall microbial ecosystem composition differs markedly between groups, e.g.
BMI.

Here is one option as an example:

1.  Aggregate the taxa into bacterial families (for example) - use `tax_agg()`
2.  Transform the microbial data with the centered-log-ratio transformation - use `tax_transform()`
3.  Perform PCA with the clr-transformed features (equivalent to Aitchison distance PCoA) - use `ord_calc()`
4.  Plot the first 2 axes of this PCA ordination, colouring samples by group and adding taxon loading arrows to visualize which taxa generally differ across your samples - use `ord_plot()`
5.  Customise the theme of the ggplot as you like and/or add features like ellipses or annotations

```{r ordination-plot, dpi=120}
# perform ordination
unconstrained_aitchison_pca <- dietswap %>%
  tax_agg("Family") %>%
  tax_transform("clr") %>%
  ord_calc()
# ord_calc will automatically infer you want a "PCA" here
# specify explicitly with method = "PCA", or you can pick another method

# create plot
pca_plot <- unconstrained_aitchison_pca %>%
  ord_plot(
    plot_taxa = 1:6, colour = "bmi_group", size = 1.5,
    tax_vec_length = 0.325,
    tax_lab_style = tax_lab_style(max_angle = 90, aspect_ratio = 1),
    auto_caption = 8
  )

# customise plot
customised_plot <- pca_plot +
  stat_ellipse(aes(linetype = bmi_group, colour = bmi_group), linewidth = 0.3) + # linewidth not size, since ggplot 3.4.0
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1, clip = "off") # makes rotated labels align correctly

# show plot
customised_plot
```

### PERMANOVA

You visualised your ordinated data in the plot above.
Below you can see how to perform a PERMANOVA to test the significance of BMI's association with overall microbial composition.
This example uses the Family-level Aitchison distance to correspond with the plot above.

```{r permanova}
# calculate distances
aitchison_dists <- dietswap %>%
  tax_transform("identity", rank = "Family") %>%
  dist_calc("aitchison")

# the more permutations you request, the longer it takes
# but also the more stable and precise your p-values become
aitchison_perm <- aitchison_dists %>%
  dist_permanova(
    seed = 1234, # for set.seed to ensure reproducibility of random process
    n_processes = 1, n_perms = 99, # you should use at least 999!
    variables = "bmi_group"
  )

# view the permanova results
perm_get(aitchison_perm) %>% as.data.frame()

# view the info stored about the distance calculation
info_get(aitchison_perm)
```

### Constrained partial ordination

You could visualise the effect of the (numeric/logical) variables in your permanova directly using the `ord_plot` function with constraints (and conditions).

```{r constrained-ord}
perm2 <- aitchison_dists %>%
  dist_permanova(variables = c("weight", "african", "sex"), seed = 321)
```

We'll visualise the effect of nationality and bodyweight on sample composition, after first removing the effect of sex.

```{r constrained-ord-plot, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, dpi=120}
perm2 %>%
  ord_calc(constraints = c("weight", "african"), conditions = "female") %>%
  ord_plot(
    colour = "nationality", size = 2.5, alpha = 0.35,
    auto_caption = 7,
    constraint_vec_length = 1,
    constraint_vec_style = vec_constraint(1.5, colour = "grey15"),
    constraint_lab_style = constraint_lab_style(
      max_angle = 90, size = 3, aspect_ratio = 0.8, colour = "black"
    )
  ) +
  stat_ellipse(aes(colour = nationality), linewidth = 0.2) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", guide = guide_legend(position = "inside")) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 0.8, clip = "off", xlim = c(-4, 4)) +
  theme(legend.position.inside = c(0.9, 0.1), legend.background = element_rect())
```

### Correlation Heatmaps

microViz heatmaps are powered by `ComplexHeatmap` and annotated with taxa prevalence and/or abundance.

```{r, corheatmap, dpi=120, fig.width=7, fig.height=5.5}
# set up the data with numerical variables and filter to top taxa
psq <- dietswap %>%
  ps_mutate(
    weight = recode(bmi_group, obese = 3, overweight = 2, lean = 1),
    female = if_else(sex == "female", true = 1, false = 0),
    african = if_else(nationality == "AFR", true = 1, false = 0)
  ) %>%
  tax_filter(
    tax_level = "Genus", min_prevalence = 1 / 10, min_sample_abundance = 1 / 10
  ) %>%
  tax_transform("identity", rank = "Genus")

# randomly select 30 taxa from the 50 most abundant taxa (just for an example)
set.seed(123)
taxa <- sample(tax_top(psq, n = 50), size = 30)
# actually draw the heatmap
cor_heatmap(
  data = psq, taxa = taxa,
  taxon_renamer = function(x) stringr::str_remove(x, " [ae]t rel."),
  tax_anno = taxAnnotation(
    Prev. = anno_tax_prev(undetected = 50),
    Log2 = anno_tax_box(undetected = 50, trans = "log2", zero_replace = 1)
  )
)
```
